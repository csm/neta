= Packets table =

Probably a straightforward NSTableView, with columns for 

  * Date. In seconds, or readable date? (2006-12-25 18:11:32)
  * Source/dest in ether address, IP address, something else, if appropriate.

Customizable layout?

Copy here will copy the whole captured packet. Multiple selection will copy multiple packets.

= Packet detail outline =

I'm thinking just similar to Wireshark here: one line per protocol level, and the disclosure triangle expands the details for that protocol. This should be a straightforward data model for NSOutlineView.

Parts are selectable, and copy here selects those parts of the packet.

= Packet detail hex =

This will probably be a three-column text view, split into offset, hex bytes, then "printable" bytes (similar output to 'hexdump -C'). Selection is the interesting thing: if you select one of the two data columns, that will also select the same data in the other data column. Maybe selecting the offset column selects that whole "line".

Copying here selects _parts_ of the packet.
